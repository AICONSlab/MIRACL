MIRACL v. 0.5

-------------------
CONNECTIVITY (CONNECT)


- miracl_connect_label_graph_proj_dens.py

[ Get experiment project density & connectivity matrix for Allen label ]

    1) Query Allen connectivity API for injection experiments & finds the experiment with highest proj volume
    2) Outputs a connectivity graph of that experiment & its projection density images (as nii & tif)


- miracl_coonect_ROI_matrix_connectogram.py

[ Get experiment connectivity matrix, projection & connectogram for ROI in Allen space ]

    1) Finds the largest N Allen labels in the Region of Interest and extracts its N closely connected regions
    (targets sorted by normalized projection volume) from the Allen Connectivity atlas.
    2) Outputs a connectivity matrix of the primary injected sites (labels) & their most common targets.

-------------------
REGISTRATION (REG)


- miracl_reg_clar-allen_whole_brain.sh

[

	1) Registers CLARITY data (down-sampled images) to Allen Reference mouse brain atlas
	2) Warps Allen annotations to the original high-res CLARITY space
	3) Warps the higher-resolution CLARITY to Allen space


- miracl_reg_mri-allen.sh

    1) Registers in-vivo or ex-vivo MRI data to Allen Reference mouse brain Atlas
	2) Warps Allen annotations to the MRI space


-------------------
SEGMENTATION (SEG)


- miracl_seg_clarity_neurons_wrapper.sh

	1) Segments neurons in cleared mouse brain of sparse or nuclear stains in 3D


- miracl_seg_voxelize_parallel.py

    1) Voxelizes segmentation results into density maps with Allen atlas resolution


- miracl_seg_feat_extract.py

    1) Computes features of segmented image and summarizes them per label
