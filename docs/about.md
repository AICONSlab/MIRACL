## AICONS Lab

The **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence and **CO**mputational
**N**euro**S**ciences (AICONS) Lab is located at the Sunnybrook
Research Institute of the University of Toronto and is part of the
Black Centre for Brain Resilience and Recovery, Harquail Centre for 
Neuromodulation, and Temerty Centre for AI Research and Education in 
Medicine.

Our work combines technical and translational research, focusing 
on the development of novel AI, computational and imaging tools to 
probe, predict and understand neuronal and vascular circuit 
alterations, and model brain pathology in neurological disorders, 
including Alzheimer’s disease, stroke and traumatic brain injury.
