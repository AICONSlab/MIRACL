MIRACL (Multi-modal Image Registration And Connectivity anaLysis) is a general-purpose, open-source pipeline for automated:

1) Registration of mice clarity data to the Allen reference atlas
2) Segmentation & feature extraction of mice clarity data in 3D (Sparse & nuclear staining)
3) Registration of mice multimodal imaging data (MRI & CT, in-vivo & ex-vivo) to Allen reference atlas
4) Tract or label specific connectivity analysis based on the Allen connectivity atlas
5) Comparison of diffusion tensort imaging (DTI)/tractography, virus tracing using CLARITY & Allen connectivity atlas
6) Statistical analysis of CLARITY & Imaging data
7) Atlas generation & Label manipulation
