\*\*NEW FEATURE RELEASE IN EARLY 2024\*\*
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**AI-based Cartography of Ensembles (ACE) segmentation method and workflow** 
is an end-to-end, automated pipeline that seamlessly integrates cutting-edge 
deep learning segmentation models (both Vision transformer and CNN-based 
architectures), registration algorithms, and advanced statistical methods to 
enable an unbiased and generalizable mapping of 3D alterations in neuronal 
activity, morphology, or connectivity at the sub-regional and laminar levels 
beyond atlas-defined regions.

:program:`ACE` has been develop by `Ahmadreza Attarpour <https://github.com/AAttarpour>`_,
`Maged Goubran <https://github.com/mgoubran>`_ and `Jonas Osmann <https://github.com/jono3030>`_
and will be available as part of MIRACL in **early January 2024**.

------

We recommend using MIRACL with the Docker or Singularity containers we provide 
but it can also be installed locally. See our 
:doc:`installation instructions <./installation/installation>` for more information.
