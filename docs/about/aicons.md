# Artificial Intelligence and COmputational NeuroSciences (AICONS) Lab

We are located at the Sunnybrook Research Institute of the University
of Toronto and are part of the Black Centre for Brain Resilience 
and Recovery, Harquail Centre for Neuromodulation, and Temerty 
Centre for AI Research and Education in Medicine.

Our work combines technical and translational research, focusing 
on the development of novel AI, computational and imaging tools to 
probe, predict and understand neuronal and vascular circuit 
alterations, and model brain pathology in neurological disorders, 
including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, stroke and traumatic brain injury.
