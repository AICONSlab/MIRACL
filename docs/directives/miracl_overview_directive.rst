:program:`MIRACL` (**M**\ ulti-modal **I**\ mage **R**\ egistration **A**\ nd 
**C**\ onnectivity ana\ **L**\ ysis) is a general-purpose, open-source pipeline 
for automated:

#. Registration of mice CLARITY data to the Allen Reference Atlas
#. Segmentation and feature extraction of mice CLARITY data in 3D (Sparse and 
   nuclear staining)
#. Registration of mice multimodal imaging data (MRI & CT, in-vivo & ex-vivo) 
   to Allen Reference Atlas
#. Tract or label specific connectivity analysis based on the Allen 
   Connectivity Atlas
#. Comparison of diffusion tensort imaging (DTI)/tractography, virus tracing 
   using CLARITY and Allen Connectivity Atlas
#. Statistical analysis of CLARITY and imaging data
#. Atlas generation and Label manipulation
