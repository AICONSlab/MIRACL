.. note::
   Note that the :program:`Docker Compose` syntax is different if 
   you installed it using the standalone method. :program:`Compose 
   standalone` uses the ``-compose`` syntax instead of the current standard 
   syntax ``compose``. The above command would thus be ``docker-compose up -d``
   when using :program:`Compose standalone`.
